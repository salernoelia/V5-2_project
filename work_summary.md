Implemented missing PDE solver with explicit Euler FTCS scheme using Numba JIT compilation. Solver includes 5-point stencil Laplacian for diffusion terms and nonlinear reaction terms with negative density protection. Tried multiple parameter sets to generate spatial patterns. Initial attempts failed due to predator extinction when beta alpha less than m h resulting in negative steady states. Systems with positive steady states converged to uniform distributions eliminating spatial heterogeneity. Tested various diffusion ratios from Dv/Du equals 2 to 100 with different reaction parameters. Final working configuration uses Du 0.1 Dv 5.0 r 1.5 K 100 m 0.25 alpha 0.018 h 0.03 beta 0.6 on 128x128 grid over 100m domain. Initial conditions use localized patches at grid positions N/4 and 3N/4 with high prey low predator and mixed densities. After 200 days simulation shows persistent spatial gradients prey 79.31 to 79.60 predator 57.82 to 58.47 with nonzero standard deviations 0.07 and 0.16 respectively. Visualization confirms spatial structure with smooth gradients from initial heterogeneous patches. Time step limited by CFL condition dt max equals dx squared over 4 D max gives 0.0305 using 0.0275 for stability. Total 7281 time steps computed. Periodic boundary conditions implemented via modulo arithmetic in nested loops. System shows coexistence steady state at u star 75.76 v star 66.12 but transient dynamics preserve spatial variation.
